\chapter{Appendix A: A Note on Data Sources}\indent%


Source data has been gathered from several places:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rocketship Education financial statements from its founding to the present are available from Rocketship's web site: \url{https://www.rocketshipschools.org/about/board-of-directors/financial-statements/}.
  \item Rocketship also maintains an archive of board meetings and agenda, somewhat erratically at \url{https://www.rocketshipschools.org/about/board-of-directors/board-agendas-archive/}. Current board agendas, materials, and minutes are at \url{https://www.rocketshipschools.org/about/board-of-directors/board-agendas-23-24/}. Some links are no longer active; some meetings are missing agendas and board packets. In any case, the meeting archive currently (April 2024) does not extend back beyond 2017. Board meeting agendas, materials, and minutes prior to 2017 were obtained before Rocketship removed access to them. Items no longer available from Rocketship are available from the author upon request.
  \item Rocketship Education's real estate holdings were first identified from Rocketship's financial statements and then details of each holding were obtained by searching the Santa Clara County Assessor's Office property records: \url{https://www.sccassessor.org/online-services/property-search/real-property}
  \item Financial data derived from Rocketship's annual consolidated finacial statements is at \url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c4akEKFj9bmVfLFQwi7ewMifSjRbrw5xpjh_UjO4oYY/edit?usp=sharing}. Much of that data is also in this dissertation's appendices.
  \item The California Department of Education (CDE) and the California Department of Finanace make available much of the data they collect from charter schools. Financial data is at \url{https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/fd/fd/index.asp} and \url{https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/csfa/csfgp/awardees.asp}.
  \item The Santa Clara County Office of Education, Charter School Department makes its files available at \url{https://www.sccoe.org/supoffice/charter-schools-office/documents/forms/allitems.aspx}.
\end{itemize}
