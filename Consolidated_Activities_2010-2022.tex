\chapter{Consolidated Activities (2010-2022)}\label{ch:consolidated_activities_2010-22}
This table describes the origin (categories) of the funds Rocketship uses to pay for the various categories of operating costs (expenses) that it incurs. It is remarkable that its net assets have grown every year from 2010 until 2022 except for a likely pandemic-induced drop in 2022. This is a performance that is better than most startups in Silicon Valley.
