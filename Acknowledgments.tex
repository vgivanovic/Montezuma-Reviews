My debts are many.
  
To Diane Ravitch, whose fierce and intellectually rigorous focus on the inequities of public education, I owe my much weaker commitment to changing public policy so that every child gets the education they need to flourish. To Robin Avelar LaSalle, I owe her sparking my interest in drighting the inequities in educational policy in California. To Roxana Marachi, my dissertation advisor, to whom, put simply, I owe my doctorate. I truly cannot imagine a better committee chair and I hope to accomplish half of what she has. To Noni Mendoza Reis, Gordon Lafer, and Ferdinand Rivera, members of my committee, thank you for your valuable feedback that improved my writing and thinking. To Arnold Danzig, Bradley Porfilio, and Ferdinand Revera, Ed.D. Program Directors, I owe much gratitude for their support in my journey to a doctorate. To my long suffering wife, Carol, and to our two children, I owe so much for their tolerance of my quirks and the vast number of books that crept into every corner of our house. To the professors in the Ed.D. program who did their very best to instill in me the requisites of becoming an education leader, thank you. To Jennifer Carlstrom, who was the first to guide me on my journey through the thicket of educational policy in California, thank you for getting me started. To Jeff Baier, Sandra McGonagle, Randy Kenyon, Erik Walukiewicz, and Carrie Bosco (herself an Ed.D. graduate), all senior administrators in the Los Altos School District, thank you for listening graciously to my many suggestions from someone who has never actually run a school district. Lastly, to Cohort 6 (Class of '22), and especially to Gigi Carunungan and Candice Nance, thank you many times over for your unwavering support (and ceaseless pestering, "Is it done yet?").
